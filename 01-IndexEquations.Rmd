# General Overview
Most index equations are expressed algebraically. This make it convenient to transform them into R codes and make the whole process more reproducible.

<br>

## 1. Inadequacy scores
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}
  c_i= \sum_{j=1}^n w_j √ó g_{ij} \label{ci}\tag{eq1}

  \end{align}
```
  
| Where,
|     ci = Inadequacy scores of a respondent. 
|     wj = Weight of an indicator.
|     gij = Inadequacy binary status assigned based on empowerment cutoff.


<br>

## 2. Disempowered Headcount ratio
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}
  H_n=  \frac{q}{N} \label{Hn}\tag{eq2}
  \end{align}
```

| Where, 
|     ùëû  is the number of respondents identified as disempowered and 
|     N is the total number of respondents. 

 
<br>

## 3. Empowered Headcount ratio
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  H_e  = 1-H_n \label{He}\tag{eq3} 
  \end{align}
```
  
<br>

## 4. Average Inadequacy Score
This score measures the intensity of disempowerment individuals who failed to attain adequate achievement.
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
 A_n =  \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_i(k)}{q} \label{An}\tag{eq4}
  \end{align}
```

| Where,
|     ci(k) is the censored inadequacy score 
|     q is the number identified as disempowered.


<br>

## 5. Average Adequacy Score
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  A_a  = 1-A_n \label{Aa}\tag{eq5}
  \end{align}	
```


<br>

## 6. Disempowerment Index
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  MO  = H_n  √ó A_n \label{M01}\tag{eq6}
  \end{align}	
```

<br>

## 7. Alternative way of expressing M0
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  MO=  \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{i=1}^{N}{c_i(k)} \label{M02}\tag{eq7}
  \end{align}
```

<br>

## 8. Five domains of empowerment
5DE Index assesses the degree to which women are empowered in the five domains of empowerment in agriculture.
    
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  FiveDE = 1-MO \label{5DE1}\tag{eq8}
  \end{align}
```
  
<br>

## 9. Alternative way of computing 5DE
```{block, echo=TRUE}
\begin{align}	
FiveDE = H_e + (H_n  √ó A_a) \label{5DE2}\tag{eq9}
\end{align}
```

| Where, 
|     He = Empowered headcount ratio
|     Hn = Disempowered headcount ratio
|     Aa = The average adequacy score of disempowered

>Contribution of each indicator to disempowerment is determined by decomposing the M0 into its censored components. The headcount ratio is computed to represent a proportion of the respondents who are disempowered and have inadequacy status in the specified indicator.

<br>

## 10. Head count ratio per indicator

```{block, echo=TRUE}
\begin{align}	
  {h_j(k)} =  \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_{ij}(k)  \label{hjk}\tag{eq10}
  \end{align}
```

| Where,
|     hj(k) = Indicator headcount ratio
|     gij(k) = Indicator inadequacy status


>We can apply pre-determined indicator weights and compute the absolute and relative contribution of an indicator.

<br>

## 11. Absolute contribution of indicator

```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
  {Abs_j} = {w_j} √ó {h_j}(k) \label{Absj}\tag{eq11}
  \end{align}
```

<br>

## 12. Relative contribution of indicator
```{block, echo=TRUE}
  \begin{align}	
 {Rel_j} = {w_j} √ó {h_j}(k) √ó {100} \label{Relj}\tag{eq12}
  \end{align}
```
